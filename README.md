  For this project, I utilized machine-learning techniques such as KNN, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and K-means clustering from the text data. I worked with the sms_spam_cleaned.csv dataset, which contains SMS messages labeled as spam or ham (legitimate messages). These datasets, originally from the UCI Data Repository, include spam messages collected from the Grumbletext website and ham messages sourced from the NUS SMS Corpus (NSC). Grumbletext is a UK forum where people publicly report SMS spam messages they receive. The dataset is condensed to only two features, which are: Type, which indicates whether a message is spam or ham, and Msg, which contains the actual text of the message.
  To perform binary clustering, I applied an unsupervised method to split the data into two cluster groups, which were spam and no spam. Through this method, I was able to determine the effectiveness of the clusters in identifying spam and measuring accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. To improve the clustering, I used K-means clustering to further analyze the dataset, identifying clusters that were predominantly spam or ham. In order to visualize the result, I generated word clouds to visualize keywords in each cluster and examined misclassified messages to understand why they were grouped incorrectly. I tested my clustering by creating and classifying new SMS messages, verifying that they aligned with the expected clusters. In addition, I customized the word clouds by modifying colors, shapes, and resolutions to differentiate between them.
  Then, I conducted a Principal Component Analysis to reduce dimensionality while preserving the essential information. Through this, I was able to create a visualization of the results using an interactive 3D scatter plot using Plotly. I had to test and determine how many principal components were needed to maintain 50% of the dataâ€™s variance. It is now easier to identify outlier spam messages and understand why they deviated greatly from the main spam clusters. 
  To round off the project, I designed a classifier to predict whether an SMS message was spam, justifying my choice of TF-IDF and stemming. I evaluated its performance using a train-test split and examined my choices with graphical and numerical analysis. 
  I have prepared a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) with clearly marked and well-explained responses. My evaluation was based on the correct application of unsupervised learning, the clarity and accuracy of my clustering analysis, the proper execution of PCA and classification models, and the justification of my design decisions. This project was a valuable opportunity to apply machine learning concepts to real-world spam detection. 
  It helped me gain hands-on experience in clustering, dimensionality reduction, and classification, while also deepening my understanding of the challenges involved in processing and analyzing text data.
